## 📂 Projects

### 🎧 Headphone Amplifier
[View Project on GitHub](https://github.com/pavlokostushevych/Headphone-Amplifier)
Designed and built a headphone amplifier by selecting components and creating the PCB layout using KiCad. After ordering the parts and manufacturing the PCB, I soldered and tested the device using a power supply, oscilloscope, and multimeter.

### ⏰ Nixie Tube Clock
[View Project on GitHub](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/headphone-amplifier)
Designed the schematic of a Nixie tube clock with KiCad, selecting components and analyzing vintage tubes and an RTC module. Programmed an Arduino Mini (C++/Arduino IDE), soldered the circuit on a prototype board, and tested its functionality.

### 🌈 RGB Components Detector (Team Project)
[View Project on GitHub](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/headphone-amplifier)
Designed and constructed an RGB color detector, including schematic, component selection, and programming (C++/Arduino IDE).  
**My role:** component selection, C++ programming, documentation, and hardware support.

### 📇 Address Book Application (Python) (Speedrun Team Project)
[View Project on GitHub](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/headphone-amplifier)
A 7-day team project developing an address book app in Python (Visual Studio IDE).  
**My role:** Scrum Master — leading meetings, task management, development, testing, and remote coordination (Slack, Zoom, Trello). Used Git/GitHub for version control.

### 🤖 Robotic Arm Project (Diploma Thesis)
[View Project on GitHub](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/headphone-amplifier)
Designed and built a 4 DOF articulated robotic arm with kinematics analysis, control algorithms (C++/Arduino IDE), and position error compensation. Included mechanical construction, electronics integration, power supply setup, and two control interfaces (computer and mobile via Bluetooth) using Visual Studio and .NET Framework.
